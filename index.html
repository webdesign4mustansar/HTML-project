                <p>The Great Pyramid, the only wonder that still exists, stood as the world's tallest human-made structure for nearly 4,000 years.<br> Erected around 2560 B.C.E on the west bank of the Nile River, the Great Pyramid serves as the tomb of the
                    fourth-century
                    <br> Pharaoh Khufu (Cheops). It is the largest of the three pyramids at Giza. The original height from the base to the peak was 147 meters.

                <p>The Hanging of Gardens of Babylon was built in 600 BC and was destroyed by earthquake in 226 BC. The first and most interesting fact<br>about the garden is that there is significant controversy about whether the gardens existed at all.

                <p>The Statue of Zeus at Olympia was built in 430 BC and was destroyed by fire in 426 AD. Carved from ivory, on a throne of cedar wood, the <br> Statue was created by the Greek sculptor Phidias around 430 BC. In its right hand was a life-size
                    statue of Nike, the goddess of victory, and in <br>its left was a large scepter topped with an eagle. The statue, nearly 40 feet tall, was said to fill the entire width of one of the aisles of the temple of <br>Zeus, and it heads nearly
                    scrapped the temple's ceiling.</p>

                <p>In Ephesus (an ancient city in what is now weather Turkey), a temple was constructed that was reportedly so magnificent it caused philo of<br> Byzantium to say:"I have seen the walls and Hanging Gardens of ancient Babylon, the statue of
                    Olympian Zeus, the Colossus of Rhodes, the <br> mighty work of the high Pyramids and the tomb of Mausolus. But when I saw the temple at Ephesus rising to the clouds, all these other <br>wonders were put in the shade".</p>

                <p>Among the most impressive structures to house the deceased was the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus. The mausoleum was designed between<br> 353 and 350 B.C.E. by the Greek architects Satyrus and Pythis. It was created for Maussollos, a governor
                    in the Persian Empire, and his wife<br> and sister Artemisia II of Caria, who initiated its construction upon her husband's death.<br><br> The mausoleum stood approximately 41 meters (135 feet) high and was adorned with intricate exterior
                    carvings and precious works of art.<br> Despite standing for centuries and even surviving a raid by Alexander of Macedonia, a series of earthquakes finally rocked it to its core.<br> All that remains are a few scattered pieces of its
                    foundation.

                <p>The Colossus of Rhodes was built in 282 BC and was destroyed by earthquake in 226 BC. In 294 BC, the people of the island of Rhodes began<br> building a colossal statue of the sun god Helios. They believed that it was because of his blessings
                    that they were able to withstand a long siege<br>on the island and emerge victorious.<br><br> The Colossus was built with bronze, reinforced with iron, and weighted with stones. While it is often depicted straddling Mandrakion harbor,
                    this
                    <br>is now considered technically impossible; and therefore, it likely stood beside the harbor.<br><br> The statue was toppled by an earthquake in 226 BC. It snapped at the knees and fell over on to the land. The Oracle of Delphi suggested
                    that it<br>fell because the people of Rhodes had offended Helios, and they decided not to rebuild it.<br><br> The statue remained on the ground until 654 AD., and even broken, it was so impressive that many traveled to see it.

                <p>This ancient lighthouse, considered a technical masterpiece that served as the model for all lighthouses that followed, was constructed on Pharos,<br> an island in the harbor of Alexandria in Egypt, known as Kemet by its ancient citizens.
                    It was completed between 285 and 247 B.C.E.<br><br>The Lighthouse of Alexandria was severely damaged by earthquakes in 965 C.E., 1303 C.E., and 1323 C.E. It was completely gone by 1480 C.E. Today,<br> visitors to the site where the
                    lighthouse stood encounter the Egyptian fort Qaitbay, which was built using some of the stones from the lighthouse ruins.</p>

            The Ancient Wonders of the World were seven incredible structures built thousands of years ago. Only one is still standing today - the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt.<br> It's a massive tomb built for a pharaoh that's taller than a 40-story
            building
            <br>Sadly, these last six were destroyed by earthquakes, fires, or just time itself. But they show just how creative and skilled ancient builders were, even without modern<br> technology. You can visit these places to enjoy and see the Ancient
            wonders of World physically and gain more experience about these places.
